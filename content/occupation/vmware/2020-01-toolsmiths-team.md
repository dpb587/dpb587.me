I complete my prior initiative on Cross-Team Engineering.

My next assigned project is not ready to begin, and I join Toolsmiths for the interim.

* Maintain development tools for internal teams and Cloud Foundry community.
* Maintain VMware vSphere testing infrastructure for product teams.
* Migrate hardware and service monitoring to VMware Wavefront.
