title: La Luz Trail

The [La Luz Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/new-mexico/la-luz-trail) goes from the base of the [Sandia Mountains](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/cibola/recarea/?recid=71051) at the outskirts of Albuquerque up to the [Sandia Crest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/wildflowers/regions/southwestern/SandiaCrest/index.shtml). This was my first time making the difficult hike and was a little surprised to still find so much snow along the upper third. The [tram](https://sandiapeak.com/) was out of service for some maintenance, so I did the full, round-trip hike.
