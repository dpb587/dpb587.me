title: Bank Card Readers for Web Applications

I made a web-based [point of sale][1] for [The Loopy Ewe][2], but it needed an easier way to accept credit cards aside
from manually typing in the credit card details. To help with that, we got a keyboard-emulating USB magnetic card reader
and I wrote a [parse]({{< appendix-ref "2013-03-23-bank-card-readers-for-web-applications/cardparser.js" >}})
for the [card data][4] and convert it to an object. It is fairly simple to hook up to a form
and enable a card to be scanned while the user is focused in the name or number fields...

```javascript
require(
    [ 'payment/form/cardparser', 'vendor/mootools' ],
    function (paymentFormCardparser) {
        function storeCard(card) {
            $('payment[card][name]').value = card.name;
            $('payment[card][number]').value = card.number;
            $('payment[card][expm]').value = card.expm;
            $('payment[card][expy]').value = card.expy;
            $('payment[card][code]').focus();
        }

        paymentFormCardparser
            .listen($('payment[card][name]'), storeCard)
            .listen($('payment[card][number]'), storeCard)
        ;
    }
);
```

It acts as a very passive listener without requiring the user to do anything special - if there is no card reader
connected then the form field is simply a regular field for keyboard input.
