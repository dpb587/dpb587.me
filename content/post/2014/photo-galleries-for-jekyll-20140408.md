title: Photo Galleries for Jekyll
---

I had a trip to London and Iceland several weeks ago, and I wanted to share some of those photos with people. In the
past I've put those sorts of photo galleries on Facebook, but some friends don't have accounts there and I figured I
could/should just keep my photos with my other personal stuff here.

Unlike [WordPress][1], [Jekyll][2] doesn't really have a concept of photo galleries, and since Jekyll is a static site
generator it makes things a little more difficult. I looked through [several][3] [other][4] [posts][5] discussing Jekyll
photo galleries, but they all seemed a bit more primitive than what I wanted. I wanted to:

 * stick with existing Jekyll paradigms (e.g. [markdown][8] file to static page),
 * retain metadata about my photos (e.g. location data, camera EXIF data),
 * support multiple views about my galleries (e.g. photo list, map, slideshow),
 * ensure photos can have landing pages and be easily navigated, and
 * avoid committing images to my git repository.

After giving it some thought, I realized this was going to be a multi-step process.

 1. Script the process of exporting my existing photos to Jekyll-friendly structures.
 1. Find a Jekyll/[Liquid][7] plugin to enumerate directories/files and use the results.
 1. Create templates and pages for my gallery and its photos.
 1. Publish the site!


# Step 1: Export existing photo galleries (iPhoto) {#step-1}

I take pretty much all my photos with my phone and those photos then get synced up with iPhoto. At the end of my trip, I
browse through the photos and create an album of interesting ones. Normally I don't go through and give every photo a
title and description, but if I'm planning on sharing them I add brief notes within iPhoto.

I knew my iPhoto metadata was stored in `AlbumData.xml`, but I've always had poor performance with massive XML data
files. I decided to start with a different approach: [AppleScript][9]. The following snippet gets me the file paths of
all the photos (in order) from whatever album I ask for:

```applescript
on run argv
    set output to ""

    tell application "iPhoto"
        set vAlbum to first item of (get every album whose name is (item 1 of argv))
        set vPhotos to get every photo in vAlbum
        
        repeat with vPhoto in vPhotos
            set output to output & original path of vPhoto & "
"
        end repeat
    end tell
        
    return output
end run
```

So, to get the photos in my album named "London-Iceland Trip" I can do:

{{< terminal >}}

  {{< terminal-input >}}

    ```bash
    osascript export-iphoto-album.applescript 'London-Iceland Trip'
    ```

  {{< /terminal-input >}}

  {{< terminal-output >}}

    ```
    ~/Pictures/iPhoto Library.photolibrary/Masters/2014/03/13/20140313-154842/IMG_0303.JPG
    ~/Pictures/iPhoto Library.photolibrary/Masters/2014/03/13/20140313-154842/IMG_0308.JPG
    ...snip...
    ```

  {{< /terminal-output >}}

{{< /terminal >}}

With some tweaks I can get more than just the path to a photo:

{{< terminal >}}

  {{< terminal-input >}}

    ```bash
    osascript export-iphoto-album.applescript 'London-Iceland Trip'
    ```

  {{< /terminal-input >}}

  {{< terminal-output >}}

    ```yaml
    altitude: 16
    latitude: 51.50038
    longitude: -0.12786667
    title: A Classic View
    date: Thursday, March 6, 2014 at 4:44:12 PM
    path: ~/Pictures/iPhoto Library.photolibrary/Masters/2014/03/13/20140313-154842/IMG_0303.JPG
    title: A Classic View

    ------------
    ...snip...
    ```

  {{< /terminal-output >}}

{{< /terminal >}}

The next piece is to write something which will clean up the output, resize the photos, and write out all the different
Jekyll files. For that I created a [PHP][10] script since it was going to be easiest for me. Once complete, I then just
pipe the export results to the script and specify the image sizes I want:

{{< terminal >}}

  {{< terminal-input >}}

    ```bash
    osascript ../jekyll-gallery/export-iphoto.applescript 'London-Iceland Trip' \
      | php ../jekyll-gallery/convert.php 2014-london-iceland-trip \
        --export 96x96 --export 200x200 --export 640 --export 1280
    ```

  {{< /terminal-input >}}

  {{< terminal-output >}}

    ```
    df5150c-a-classic-view...96x96...200x200...640...1280...mdown...done
    7cf02b5-night...96x96...200x200...640...1280...mdown...done
    ...snip...
    ```

  {{< /terminal-output >}}

{{< /terminal >}}

Once complete, all the resized images are in `asset/gallery/2014-london-iceland-trip` and my markdown files with the
photo details are in `gallery/2014-london-iceland-trip` and they're easily [readable][15].


# Step 2: Jekyll plugin {#step-2}

At a minimum, I wanted to have a listing of all the photos in a gallery index page. After some searches, I found
[two][11] [scripts][12] which became the inspiration for my final plugin. My [final plugin][16] looks like:

```
Tag:
  loopdir
Attributes:
  match: a pattern to match files within the path (e.g. "*.md")
  parse: whether to load the file and parse for YAML front matter
  path: a directory, relative to the site root, to find files
  sort: a property to search by (e.g. "path")
Result:
  An "item" object is exposed to the template with a "page"-like structure.
  If parsing is enabled, the YAML properties are available as "item.title".
```

Which means I can easily compose a simple photo list with:

```jinja-html
{% loopdir path:"gallery/2014-london-iceland-trip" match:"*.md" sort:"ordering" %}
    <a href="/{{ item.fullname }}.html">
        <img alt="Photo: {{ item.title }}" height="200" src="/{{ item.fullname }}~200x200.jpg" title="{{ item.title }}" width="200" />
    </a>
{% endloopdir %}
```

I reuse this plugin elsewhere for regular directory listings.


# Step 3: Create templates {#step-3}

I've started out with two reusable templates in my `_includes` directory:

 1. [Gallery List][13] - a simple listing of thumbnails from all the photos in the gallery
 1. [Interactive Map][14] - an interactive map showing where all the photos were taken

I can pass arguments (like the gallery name) to the include which makes it easy to embed a gallery in any page:

```jinja-html
{% include gallery_list.html gallery='2014-london-iceland-trip' %}
```


# Step 4: Publish {#step-4}

After generating everything locally, I just have to do a couple steps:

 1. Commit all the new `gallery/2014-london-iceland-trip` files (and new templates)
 1. Run `_build/aws/publish-asset.sh $AWS_S3CMD_CONFIG gallery/2014-london-iceland-trip` to upload all the exported JPGs
 1. Run `_build/aws/build.sh _build/aws/publish.sh $AWS_S3CMD_CONFIG` to upload any modifications from the rest of the
    site

To make things easier for myself and, possibly, others I put the conversion scripts in my [jekyll-gallery][17] repo.

Now I'm able to refer people to the [gallery](/gallery/2014-london-iceland-trip/) or embed the gallery somewhere
useful...
