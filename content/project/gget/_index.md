I created this project, initially, to simplify the download process for private release assets after not finding another compatible tool. I'm particularly proud of:

* the expressive command line interface that supports some powerful features.
* making the single-page website ([gget.io](https://gget.io/)) that has a clean design and very readable documentation through examples of its usage.
