I enjoy building technology to improve business processes as a software engineer. I build on industry best practices, but I use my detail-oriented and quick-learning nature to better understand how they can be adapted and improved for local needs. I bring my experiences as a developer, operator, and user to provide a more holistic perspective on solution discussions.
