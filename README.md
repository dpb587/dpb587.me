  * [`post`](content/post/) - my long-form articles or traditional blog posts
  * [`story`](content/story/) - imported content (e.g. photos, routes) organized primarily by logical events
* [`hugo`](hugo/) - configuration and theme for rendering content
  * [`themes/current`](hugo/themes/current) - site design and layout
